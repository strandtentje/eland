<h1>Rules</h1>
<h2>Scoring points and winning</h2>
<p>Teams are ranked according to the points that they earn, the team with
the most points wins. In case of a tie the amount of points gained by drinking
beer will be used as the tie breaker. The team who drank more beers will win in
this case.</p>

<p>You can score points in two different ways. The first is drinking beer, the
other is finishing problems successfully. For each finished beer you will
receive 1 point. Finishing problems will score you a number of points depending
on whether your team finished the problem first, second, third, etc. The points
gained are as follows:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>First</td>
		<td>10 points</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Second</td>
		<td>8 points</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Third</td>
		<td>7 points</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Fourth</td>
		<td>6 points</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td style="padding-right:1em;">Fifth or later</td>
		<td>5 points</td>
	</tr>
</table>


<h2>When to drink</h2>
<p>To keep things fun for everyone drinking is entirely voluntary. We expect
you to honour the following rules however:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Take a drink when your code fails to compile.</li>
	<li>Take a drink when your program crashes.</li>
	<li>Take a drink when your program doesn't produce the correct output.</li>
	<li>Take a drink when a team finishes a problem before you do.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stuck?</h2>
<p>Have you ran into a problem for which you can't think of a solution? Don't
fret, another problem will come along shortly. We aim introduce a new problem
every 30 minutes. When a team finishes a problem early we will introduce a new
problem about 10 minutes later. Or after the regular 30 minute timer, whichever
comes first. In the mean time you can earn some extra points by drinking beer!
